# Commit Messages to spanish

Always generate git commit messages in Spanish. Use the imperative mood and follow the Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.). Keep the commit title concise, under 50 characters, without a trailing period.

- Use imperative verbs (for example: "agrega", "corrige", "actualiza").
- The message should clearly describe the change without unnecessary technical details.
- If needed, add extra details in the commit body with lines no longer than 72 characters.
- Translate all terms with accurate technical precision.
- Example: "feat: agregar validación de formulario de login"
